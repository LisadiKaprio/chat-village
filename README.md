# Chat Village

ðŸ’» This project was done as part of my Game Design final bachelor work at the [DE:HIVE of the HTW Berlin](https://gamedesign.htw-berlin.de/dehive/).

Chat Village has been forked from the original Web Avatars repository, which was my project created as a Web Development homework from the 6th semester of my Game Design studies.

How to run it locally:

1. run `npm install` in the backend folder, then the frontend folder, then the common folder
2. create `.env` files in backend and frontend folder, and fill them out just as in `.env-example` files
3. run `npm run build` in frontend folder

then either:

4. run `npm start` in backend folder

or:

4. run `npm run dev` in frontend folder, with the ability to make changes and test them live
5. run `npm start` in backend folder
