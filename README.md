# Chat Village

ðŸ’» This project was done as part of my Game Design final bachelor work at the [DE:HIVE of the HTW Berlin](https://gamedesign.htw-berlin.de/dehive/).

Chat Village has been forked from the original Web Avatars repository, which contains a project done as a Web Development homework from the 6th semester of my Game Design studies.
